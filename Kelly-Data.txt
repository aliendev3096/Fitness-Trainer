Everything needs to be in Json format
 
Download Visual Studio Code, you can use the magnifying glass in this code editor to do a quick find and replace of words in a file.

1) Create Files These need to be populated in the category property as well.
 - shoulders.json
 - upperarms.json
 - forarms.json
 - back.json
 - waist.json
 - hips.json
 - calves.json

 2) Each file has multple muscle groups
  -Example: upperarms.json has:
    - Triceps Brachii
    - Briceps Brachii
    - Brachialis

    Within each muscle group you need to create json objects for each workout and its variation
    Keep in mind a workout can target multiple muscle groups, if so they will need to
    be in their own json object {}, as each object can only have one 
    muscle group in its "targets" property.

3) The variation property can have multiple values listed as listed
using the [] brackets. The known variations for a workout are:
 - Cable, Barbell, Dumbell, Lever (Plate Loaded), Lever Selectorized
 Sled, Weighted. YOU CAN IGNORE Streches
 - If a workout is only specific to one variation type, create an entirely separate 
    object for it.

4) You can ignore descriptive workouts, for example,
If a workout is:
Weighted 
    - Crunch
        - arms crossed
    - on ball
        -Overhead
    - Incline Crunch
        - arms crossed
You can ignore the "arms crossed" part or you list it.
Since crunch is a common type of workout its probably going to be under the workout
"crunches".
The variation for this would be:
["Weight Crunch (On Ball/Incline)" ...and them some more]
